# RDMin

A lightweight, zero-dependency Reddit browser built as a single `index.html` file using vanilla JavaScript and Tailwind CSS. 
It provides a clean, fast, and feature-rich SPA experience with URL-driven routing for dedicated subreddit and post pages, including nested comment threads and context-aware search. 
By leveraging the official Reddit JSON API, it offers a clutter-free alternative for browsing posts, media, and conversations, all while running directly in your browser with no installation required.

# TODO

<em>This is gonna be a bit hard, since the OAUTH and JSON api's are different. Although Im thinking of using Auth Tokens instead, idk.<em>
